For Second Wind 2025 we're running more main games than ever before. In order to make this happen, main games will be running throughout the Saturday & Sunday of Second Wind with some games concluding top 8 on the Saturday night.

Scheduling decisions will be based off entrant counts when regular signups conclude on June 14th, and much like recent EVO tournaments, smaller brackets will conclude earlier in the weekend.

Make sure to get in early to support your favourite games and we look forward to seeing you at Second Wind 2025. -->
